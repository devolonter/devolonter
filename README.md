### Hello there!

> I am a passionate programmer who discovered the magic of coding years ago and has been in love with it ever since.

Open-source projects are my playground, and most of my work is shared openly for you to explore, learn from, get inspired, or contribute. I hope you find my projects useful and that they spark curiosity and drive in you just as they have done for me over the years.
